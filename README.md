# Selenium-Web-Automation
A program I wrote to complete a work task. Only works for this specific task.

The task for this automation is to gather data from a specific website. It uses selenium to identify HTML elements on a page to click on or read its value. It navigates through
the site to store a value from a search result and saves it to the excel file listed in this repositroy. 


There are 15 different Addresses to search for 15 different Health Insurance plans. Then for each address and for each health plan, 3 different sub-searches need to be made to gather the number of providers in the given area. That means there are 675 unique searches to be done on the website, which would take a long time to do manually. This automation will run in the background populating the spreedsheet with the correct values from the site saving a lot of time.
